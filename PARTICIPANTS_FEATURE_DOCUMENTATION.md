# Event Participants Feature Implementation

## Overview

Added functionality that enables users to see the names of other registered participants for custom events, while maintaining privacy and security by not exposing sensitive player information.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. New API Endpoint: `/api/events/[id]/participants`

**Purpose**: Fetch list of participants for a specific event
**Method**: GET
**Privacy-First Design**: Only exposes participant names, not player IDs or other sensitive data

**Response Structure**:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "id": "event-id",
    "name": "Event Name"
  },
  "participants": [
    {
      "id": "registration-id",
      "status": "registered|reserved",
      "registeredAt": "2025-10-14T...",
      "playerName": "Player Name",
      "hasDecklistSubmitted": true,
      "isBringingDecklistOnsite": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security Features**:

- ✅ Only participant names are exposed
- ✅ Player IDs are NOT included in response
- ✅ Email addresses are NOT exposed
- ✅ Cancelled registrations are excluded
- ✅ Results ordered by registration date

### 2. EventParticipants Vue Component

**Location**: `/components/EventParticipants.vue`
**Features**:

- Clean, modern UI showing participant list
- Player avatars with initials
- Registration status indicators (Confirmed/Reserved)
- Decklist status badges (Online/On-site/Pending)
- Loading and error states
- Empty state handling
- Automatic refresh capability

**Props**:

- `eventId`: Event to show participants for
- `showDecklistStatus`: Whether to show decklist status indicators

### 3. Updated Event Detail Page

**Location**: `/pages/events/[id].vue`
**Enhancements**:

- Complete event information display
- Registration status for logged-in users
- Integrated participant list
- Responsive design
- Registration management links

### 4. Enhanced User Dashboard

**Location**: `/components/UserEventRegistrations.vue`
**New Features**:

- "View Other Participants" button for each registered event
- Expandable participants list within registration cards
- Seamless integration with existing registration management

### 5. Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Location**: `/tests/unit/eventParticipants.test.ts`
**Test Scenarios**:

- Valid event with multiple participants
- Different registration statuses (registered/reserved)
- Cancelled registration exclusion
- Empty events (no participants)
- Non-existent events
- Privacy validation (no sensitive data exposed)
- Security assertions (player IDs not included)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Considerations

### What IS Exposed:

- ✅ Participant names only
- ✅ Registration status (registered/reserved)
- ✅ Registration timestamp
- ✅ Decklist submission status (for events requiring decklists)

### What is NOT Exposed:

- ❌ Player IDs (internal database identifiers)
- ❌ Email addresses
- ❌ User account information
- ❌ Cancelled registrations
- ❌ Personal data beyond names

## 📱 User Experience

### For Event Participants:

1. **Transparency**: See who else is attending events
2. **Community Building**: Recognize other players in the community
3. **Event Planning**: Better understand event attendance
4. **Status Awareness**: See registration and decklist status of participants

### For Event Organizers:

1. **Participant Overview**: Clear view of who's registered
2. **Status Tracking**: Monitor decklist submission progress
3. **Capacity Planning**: Understand registration patterns

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design:

- **Modern Cards**: Clean card-based layout for participants
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges for registration and decklist status
- **Avatar System**: Automatic initials-based avatars for participants
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

### Interactive Elements:

- **Expandable Lists**: Toggle participant visibility in dashboard
- **Hover States**: Smooth transitions and feedback
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Database Queries:

```sql
-- Efficient query excluding cancelled registrations
SELECT
  registration.id,
  registration.status,
  registration.registeredAt,
  registration.decklist,
  registration.bringingDecklistOnsite,
  player.name
FROM eventRegistration
WHERE customEventId = ?
  AND status != 'cancelled'
ORDER BY registeredAt ASC
```

### Vue Composition API:

- Reactive state management
- Automatic data fetching
- Error handling
- Component lifecycle management

### Type Safety:

- Full TypeScript definitions
- Interface contracts
- Runtime validation
- Compile-time checks

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users:

- **Enhanced Transparency**: Know who else is attending

- **Status Clarity**: Understand registration and decklist requirements

### For Privacy:

- **Minimal Data Exposure**: Only essential information shared
- **Opt-in Visibility**: Information only visible to other participants
- **No Sensitive Data**: Player IDs and contact info protected
- **Secure Implementation**: Proper validation and sanitization

### For Developers:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns maintained
