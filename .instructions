# Project general coding standards

use yarn as package manager

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (\_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- File Names should never be kebab-case, use either camelCase or PascalCase
- prefer functions over arrow functions for named functions

## CSS

- use tailwindcss utility classes wherever possible

## Comments

- only comment complex logic

## Type aliases

- avoid using any type

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
