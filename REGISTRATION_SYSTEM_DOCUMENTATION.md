# PTCG Event Management System - Registration & Decklist Features

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive registration and decklist management system implemented for the PTCG Event Management application, including status management, user experience improvements, and comprehensive test coverage.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Registration Status System

- **Reserved Status**: Applied when user registers for events requiring decklists but hasn't provided one yet
- **Registered Status**: Applied when registration requirements are fulfilled (decklist submitted or user chooses to bring onsite)
- **Cancelled Status**: Preserves registration history while allowing re-registration

### 2. Simplified Registration Flow

- **One-Step Registration**: Users can register for events without being forced to submit decklists immediately
- **Dashboard Management**: Decklist submission and management moved to user dashboard
- **Smart Notifications**: Clear indication when decklist submission is required

### 3. Decklist Management Options

- **Online Submission**: Full decklist validation and storage
- **Onsite Option**: Users can choose to bring printed/written decklists to events
- **Flexible Switching**: Users can change between online and onsite options
- **Deletion Support**: Users can delete submitted decklists and revert to reserved status

### 4. Re-registration Support

- **Cancelled Registration Handling**: Users can re-register for events they previously cancelled
- **Data Reset**: Previous registration data is cleared when re-registering
- **Capacity Management**: Cancelled registrations don't count toward event capacity

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### Registration Endpoint (`/api/events/[id]/register`)

- **Method**: POST
- **Features**:
  - Status determination based on decklist requirements
  - Re-registration support for cancelled events
  - Capacity validation excluding cancelled registrations
  - Player creation/retrieval integration

#### Decklist Management (`/api/dashboard/decklist`)

- **Method**: PUT
- **Features**:
  - Decklist submission with automatic status update to "registered"
  - Onsite option toggle with status management
  - Decklist deletion with status revert to "reserved"
  - Proper authentication and validation

#### Registration Cancellation (`/api/dashboard/registrations/[id]/cancel`)

- **Method**: POST
- **Features**:
  - Status update to "cancelled" with timestamp
  - Capacity release for other participants
  - Preserves registration history

### Database Schema Updates

#### EventRegistration Model

```prisma
model EventRegistration {
  id                    String      @id @default(cuid())
  customEventId         String
  playerId              String
  status                String      @default("registered") // "registered", "reserved", "cancelled"
  decklist              String?
  bringingDecklistOnsite Boolean    @default(false)
  registeredAt          DateTime    @default(now())
  notes                 String?

  customEvent           CustomEvent @relation(fields: [customEventId], references: [id])
  player                Player      @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])

  @@unique([customEventId, playerId])
}
```

### User Interface Components

#### Dashboard (`/pages/dashboard.vue`)

- **Registration Overview**: Shows all user registrations with status indicators
- **Decklist Management**:
  - Submit new decklists with validation
  - Edit existing decklists
  - Delete decklists with confirmation
  - Toggle between online/onsite options
- **Status Visualization**: Clear indicators for reserved vs registered status

#### Registration Form (`/pages/events/register/[id].vue`)

- **Simplified Form**: Basic registration information only
- **Smart Notifications**: Highlighted decklist requirements
- **Dashboard Redirection**: Automatic redirect after registration

#### Event Details (`/pages/events/[id].vue`)

- **Capacity Display**: Shows current registrations excluding cancelled
- **Registration Status**: Integration with user's current registration state

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

- **Status Logic**: Registration status determination based on requirements
- **Re-registration**: Cancelled registration handling and data reset
- **Capacity Management**: Registration counting excluding cancelled events
- **Decklist Operations**: Submit, edit, delete, and toggle operations
- **API Validation**: Endpoint behavior and error handling

### Integration Tests

- **Complete Workflows**: End-to-end registration and decklist flows
- **Edge Cases**: Capacity limits, duplicate registrations, invalid data
- **Status Transitions**: Reserved ↔ Registered state changes

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### Before Implementation

- ❌ Forced immediate decklist submission during registration
- ❌ No way to change submission method after registration
- ❌ No re-registration capability after cancellation
- ❌ Confusing registration flow with multiple steps

### After Implementation

- ✅ Simple one-step registration process
- ✅ Flexible decklist management from dashboard
- ✅ Clear status indicators (reserved/registered)
- ✅ Seamless re-registration support
- ✅ Multiple submission options (online/onsite)

## 🔧 Configuration
